# Expense Tracker

A Python-based expense tracker built for freeCodeCampâ€™s Scientific Computing with Python certification. This project uses lambda functions to efficiently manage and filter expenses by category, demonstrating skills in OOP, list handling, and string formatting.

## Features
- Add expenses with amount and category.
- List all expenses.
- Calculate total expenses using lambda functions.
- Filter expenses by category.
- Interactive menu for user input.

## What I Learned
- Lambda functions for concise operations, similar to my Equation Solver calculations.
- List and dictionary handling, inspired by my Budget App project.
- String formatting for clean output, learned from Arithmetic Formatter.
- Input validation, drawn from my Luhn Algorithm project.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RidzuanAmani/expense-tracker.git`
2. Run the script: `python expense_tracker.py`
3. Follow the menu prompts to manage expenses.
